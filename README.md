## Telco Customer Churn

This project builds a logistic regression model in an attempt to predict customer churn for Optus. The portfolio was split into the following sections:

### 3.1 Importing Libraries and Reading Dataset
### 3.2 Exploring the data 
* A preliminary investigation of the data was conducted and data cleaned
#### 3.2.1 Investigating Age
#### 3.2.2 Investigating Monthly Spend
#### 3.2.3 Investigating NULL values
### 3.3 Understanding relationships
* Relationships between churn and the independent variables were identified
### 3.4 Converting categorical variables to dummy variables
* To include categorical variables into the model they were converted to dummy variables
### 3.5 Splitting Training and Testing Datasets
* The data set was split into training and test data that that the model could be evaluated
### 3.6 Logistic Regression Model
* An initial logistic regression model was fit and evaluated. The model was tuned and re-fit.
#### 3.6.1 Fitting the Model
#### 3.6.2 Evaluation
#### 3.6.3 Re-fitting Adjusted Model 
#### 3.6.4 Adjusted model evaluation
### 3.7 Conclusion
